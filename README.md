## David Torres Design

This project's goal is to convert my existing HTML/CSS website into a simple React app.  It's an ongoing process that will see many revisions & updates as I learn more about React and have more ambitious plans for my portfolio.

**Here's some of my plans for future versions:**
* Implement Routing for multipage experience
* Revise content to be more focused on Web Design & Development as opposed to Logos / Branding
* Remove 3rd party libraries such as Bootstrap / jQuery by developing my own grid & mobile menu behavior
* Implement "Admin" Dashboard to allow editing of page content (personal CMS)
